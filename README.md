#### Abstract 

##### Background

  parkrun, an international movement which organises free weekly 5km running events, has been widely praised for encouraging inactive individuals to participate in physical activity. Recently, parkrun received funding to establish 200 new events across England, specifically targeted at deprived communities. This study aims to investigate the relationships between geographic access, deprivation, and participation in parkrun, and to inform the planned expansion by proposing future event locations.

<br> 

##### Methods

  We conducted an ecological (spatial) analysis, using data on parkrun events, public green spaces, and English census areas. Poisson regression was applied to investigate the relationships between the distances to events, deprivation, and parkrun participation rates. Model estimates were incorporated into a location allocation analysis, to identify locations for future events that maximise deprivation-weighted parkrun participation.

##### Results
  
  The distance to the nearest event (in km) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (score) were both independently negatively associated with the parkrun participation rate. Rate ratios were 0.921 (95%CI = 0.921-0.922) and 0.959 (0.959-0.959), respectively. The identified 200 locations for new events were estimated to increase weekly runs by 6.9% (from 82,824 to 88,506). Of the additional runs, 4.1% (n=231) would come from the 10% most deprived communities.

<br> 

##### Conclusion
  
  Participation in parkrun is wide spread across England. We provide recommendations on where new parkrun events should be set up to increase participation from deprived communities. However, the creation of new events alone is unlikely to be an effective strategy. Further research is needed to study how barriers to participation can be reduced.
